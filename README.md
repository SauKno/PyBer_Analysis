# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Create a visualization of rideshare data for PyBer by city type that will provide insight for the decision-makers at PyBer.  First I created a DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Rural, Suburban) that I then put into a line graph by total weekly fares. The end result of the graph demonstrate the total weekly fares by city type for the months of January through April. Utilizing the data, I provide a summary of how the data differs by city type and how those difference can be used by PyBer to make decisions for the company's future.

## Results

Supply and Demand is the largest indicator of the average fare price in a given city type. The population alone determines how many possible drivers and users there are for PyBer. Rural PyBer users pay more for rides on avereage and the price progressively increases as the population increases. In addition, the higher the population, the more people there are for drivers and users. The Urban areas have more drivers than users, which means the fares can be lower and still have the largest profit margin out of all three city types.

The line graph above further demonstartes the impact population has on the fare data. Urban fares were the most by nearly a 1,000 over Suburban consistently throughout all 4 months. 

## Summary
I would recommend the 3 following business moves for the CEO of PyBer to address the disparities found between the three city types:
1. Increase the number of drivers in the Rural areas so the fare price can decrease and increase the possible drivers to meet user needs. If the usage increases, this can result in an increase of use in the Rural areas.
2. Provide a promotional deal that will entice users in a Rural setting to use PyBer, such as a 2 for 1 deal. 
3. Limit the number of drivers in Urban areas to be below the average number of users to increase the price in the Urban areas.
